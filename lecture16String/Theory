Strings :-

Strings are created using String class.

Strings are Immutable(cannot modify string object)

in below code:-
        String a = "naman";

        //naman is stored in String pool created in heap memory.

        //if we do
        a = "agrawal";

        //a new object agrawal will be stored in string pool,
        //and naman will be deleted during garbage collection

        String b ="agrawal"
        //here, b will point to same object as a i.e. agrawal.



        String c = new String("hello");
        String d = new String("hello");
        //here, two objects will created outside of String pool in heap memory.
        //here, we are using new keyword and telling java to create two different objects.



Comparison :-
     == :- Compare value and reference

     equals() :- Compare only value
