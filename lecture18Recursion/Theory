Recursion :-
    A function that call itself.

    Every function called, will have its separate memory in stack.


    Base Condition :- Condition where our recursion will stop making new call.
                     -The base condition is represented by answers we already have.


If there is no base condition included, the function will keep calling itself until the stack memory is filled,
and cause error named : Stack overflow


Why Recursion :-
        It helps as solving bigger and complex problem in a simple way.

        You can convert the recursion solution to iteration and vice-versa.

        Space Complexity - O(N) , space complexity is not constant because of recursive call.

        Helps to break bigger problem to small problem.


Visualizing recursion:-
          We visualize recursion using Recursion Tree

When to use recursion:-
        build understanding through practice.

        when we can break down a problem to smaller problem.

Steps/approach for recursion:-
        -Identify if you can break problem to smaller problem.

        -Write the recursion relation if needed.

        -Draw the recursive tree.

        -About the tree:-
                -- See the flow of functions, how they are getting in stack.
                -- identify and focus on the left tree calls and right tree calls.
                -- Draw the tree and pointers again and again using pen and paper.
                -- use a debugger to see the flow.

        - See how the values and what type of values, are returned at each step.
          See where the function call will come out off, in the end, you will come out of the main function.


Variables :- 1) Arguments -- are something which is different of each call
             2) Return Type -- return the value of same return type, or the recursive function
             3) Body of function -- It is specific to that call

types of recursion relation :-
        - Linear recursion relation(inefficient) -- used in fibonacci
        - Divide and Conquer recursion relation(efficient)-- used Binary Search


Imp tip -- Do not over think
           If the function have return type, return the recursive function.
