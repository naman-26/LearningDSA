Binary Search:-
Algorithm: (Array is sorted)
    1. Find the middle element
    2. Take the middle element and check if target > middle elment
       then search in right, else in left
    3. if middle element == target element //ans



Why Binary Search :-
    Total comparisons in worst case is " log N with base 2 ", where N is length of array.
    Therefore, takes less time and reduce time complexity.



If we don't known that the array is sorted in ascending or descending order (Order agnostic Binary Search)
    We have to compare first and last no.
