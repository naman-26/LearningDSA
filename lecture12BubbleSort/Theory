Bubble Sort :-

Space Complexity  = O(1).
    Constant space required. No extra space is required i.e. copying the array, etc not requried.

Also known as inplace sorting algorithm

Time complexity : Best Case: O(N) =>  Already Sorted
                  Worst Case: O(N^2) => Sorted in opposite

        N = No. of comparisons

It is a Stable Sorting Algorithm.
